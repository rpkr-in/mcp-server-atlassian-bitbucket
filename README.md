# Atlassian Bitbucket MCP Server

## What is MCP and Why Use It?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a technology that allows AI assistants like Claude to access external tools and information. Think of it as giving AI the ability to "see" and interact with your organization's systems - in this case, your Bitbucket repositories and code.

**Benefits:**

- Your AI assistant can directly access real-time Bitbucket data
- No need to copy/paste information between tools
- AI can help analyze repositories, pull requests, and code
- Keeps sensitive information secure (the AI only sees what you share)

This MCP server connects Claude, Cursor, or other compatible AI assistants with your Bitbucket instance, allowing them to list repositories, access pull requests, and view commit information.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Authentication

You have two options for authenticating with Bitbucket:

#### Option A: Get Your Atlassian API Token (Recommended if you use other Atlassian MCP servers)

1. **Create an API token** in your Atlassian account:
    - Go to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
    - Click "Create API token"
    - Give it a name (e.g., "MCP Connection")
    - Copy the generated token to a secure location

#### Option B: Create a Bitbucket App Password

1. **Create an app password** in your Bitbucket account:
    - Go to your Bitbucket settings → App passwords
    - Click "Create app password"
    - Give it a name and select appropriate permissions (at minimum: repositories:read, pull requests:read)
    - Copy the generated password to a secure location

### Step 2: Set Up Configuration

Choose one of these methods:

#### Easy Setup: Create a Config File (Recommended)

1. Create a folder called `.mcp` in your home directory
2. Create a file called `configs.json` inside it with one of these options:

**Using Atlassian API Token:**

```json
{
	"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-instance",
			"ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
			"ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
		}
	}
}
```

**Using Bitbucket App Password:**

```json
{
	"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "your-username",
			"ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD": "your_app_password"
		}
	}
}
```

Replace the values with your actual information:

- `your-instance`: Your Atlassian site name (e.g., for `example.atlassian.net`, enter `example`)
- `your-email@example.com`: Your Atlassian account email address
- `your_api_token`: The API token you created in Step 1
- `your-username`: Your Bitbucket username
- `your_app_password`: The app password you created in Step 1

#### Alternative: Use Environment Variables

If you prefer, you can provide the configuration directly when running commands using one of these options:

**Using Atlassian API Token:**

```bash
ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME=your-instance ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=your_token npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket
```

**Using Bitbucket App Password:**

```bash
ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_USERNAME=your-username ATLASSIAN_BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket
```

### Step 3: Connect Your AI Assistant

#### For Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop and click the **gear icon** (Settings) in the top-right
2. Click **Edit Config**
3. Add the following to your configuration file:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket"]
		}
	}
}
```

4. Save and close the file
5. Restart Claude Desktop
6. Click the **hammer icon** to verify Bitbucket tools are listed

#### For Cursor AI

1. Open Cursor and press `CMD + SHIFT + P` (macOS) or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Select **Cursor Settings > MCP**
3. Click **+ Add new MCP server**
4. Fill in the details:
    - **Name**: `aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket`
    - **Type**: `command`
    - **Command**: `npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket`
5. Click **Add**
6. Look for a green indicator showing the server is active

### Step 4: Start Using It!

In your AI assistant, try asking:

- "List my Bitbucket repositories"
- "Show open pull requests in repository X"
- "Get details of pull request #123"
- "Show me repositories in workspace Y"

## Available Tools

This MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool                  | Purpose                          | Example Usage                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **list-workspaces**   | View all available workspaces    | "Show me all my Bitbucket workspaces"     |
| **get-workspace**     | Get details about a workspace    | "Tell me about the acme workspace"        |
| **list-repositories** | View repositories in a workspace | "Show repositories in the acme workspace" |
| **get-repository**    | Get details about a repository   | "Show me details of the acme/api repo"    |
| **list-pullrequests** | View PRs in a repository         | "Show open PRs in acme/api repo"          |
| **get-pullrequest**   | Get details about a PR           | "Tell me about PR #123 in acme/api repo"  |

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Multiple MCP Servers

You can configure multiple MCP servers in your global config file (`$HOME/.mcp/configs.json`):

```json
{
	"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-instance",
			"ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
			"ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
		}
	},
	"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-jira": {
		"environments": {
			"ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-instance",
			"ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
			"ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
		}
	}
}
```

Then add both to your AI assistant's configuration.

### Debugging

To enable debug logging:

- Add `"DEBUG": "true"` to your environment configuration
- Or prefix commands with `DEBUG=true`

### Using as a Command-Line Tool

You can also use this as a standalone command-line tool:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket

# Then run commands
mcp-bitbucket list-repositories --workspace acme
mcp-bitbucket get-repository acme/api
mcp-bitbucket list-pullrequests --state OPEN --repository acme/api
```

## For Developers: Contributing to This Project

### Project Architecture

This MCP server follows a layered architecture:

1. **CLI/Tool Layer**: End-user interfaces with minimal logic
2. **Controller Layer**: Business logic, validation, and formatting
3. **Service Layer**: API communication and data retrieval
4. **Utilities**: Shared functionality (error handling, pagination, etc.)

The flow of data is: User → CLI/Tool → Controller → Service → Atlassian API → back up the chain with responses.

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run in development mode: `npm run dev:server`

### Development Scripts

- `npm run dev:server`: Run with hot reloading and debug logging
- `npm test`: Run test suite
- `npm run lint`: Check for code issues
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier

### Adding a New Feature

1. Implement API access in the Service layer
2. Add business logic to the Controller layer
3. Expose functionality via Tool and CLI interfaces
4. Update tests and documentation
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Documentation Standards

- Use JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Follow the AI-friendly documentation format for tools
- Include examples of using your new functionality
- Update the README if adding major features

### Standard Formatting Template for Tools

When documenting new tools, follow our standard template:

```
PURPOSE: What the tool does and its main functionality

WHEN TO USE:
